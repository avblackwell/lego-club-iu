title: LEGO Club @ IU
description: "The Lego Club at IU meets every Monday from 5-7 at Media Services in Wells Library to do a themed LEGO build as a group! You donâ€™t have to be a master builder, this is open to anyone who wants to socialize while getting to be creative! We also host special events, such as LEGO movie watches, and will potentially add competitions in the future!"
registration: Anyone can join the Lego Club! First, check out our beINvolved page and join the roster there. For access to theme polls, direct updates, and various Lego conversation, join our group on GroupMe. If you do not have GroupMe, feel free to simply arrive at Media Services during a meet to build with us.
